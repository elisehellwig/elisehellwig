### Hi!

I am a data scientist with a foundation in applied math, ecology, and population modeling. I have experience in a wide range of disciplines including high dimensional data. I work mostly with R and python, but I am also familier with SQL and have been known to ocasionally write bits of code in C++. I specialize in spatial data analysis and visualization, statistical analysis design and implementation. I have mentorship and communication training as well as extensive experience working and communicating with people of diverse backgrounds.
